# Property crud

Application consists of three parts

- fronted written in react
- backend written in nodejs
- postgres database

Each directory contains separate `readme.md`.

If postgres is not installed `./properties-backend/start-db.sh` script can be used to create docker image(NOTE: running this script multiple times clears old images).
